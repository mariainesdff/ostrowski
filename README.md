# Ostrowski's Theorem

The goal of this project is to formalize a proof of Ostrowski's Theorem for `Q` and for function fields of the form `K(X)`.

This project is part of the [2022 Xena Summer Workshop](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/2022workshop.html), held at Imperial College
London from September 26th to September 30th, 2022.

**Project Leader:** María Inés de Frutos-Fernández

**Project Members:** 
* Alistair Bill
* Billy Miao
* Michał Mrugała
* Jan Ot Piña

## Installation instructions
The formalization has been developed over Lean 3 and its matemathical library mathlib. For detailed instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and
supporting tools, visit the [Lean Community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

After installation, run the command `leanproject get mariainesdff/ostrowski` to obtain a copy of the project's source files and dependencies. To
open the project in VS Code, either run `path/to/ostrowski` on the command line, or use the "Open Folder" menu option to open the project's root
directory.
